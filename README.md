##SQL Project: WCT20 Player Analysis and Finding the Proper Playing XI for the Indian Squad.

This project involves a deep analysis of the performance of Worldcup T20 qualified players in the current IPL until May 8, 2024, and previous World Cup T20 games. The main objectives are to understand the players' performance in the WCT20 and based on this analysis, finalize the best playing XI for the Indian Squad.

The project is divided into three main segments:

Evaluation of Batting and Bowling Performance of WCT20 Qualified Players in Previous World Cups
Assessment of Batting and Bowling Performance of WCT20 Qualified Players in the Current IPL
Overall Performance Analysis
Facts
It's important to note that this analysis is based on a limited dataset and may not be 100% accurate with real-time data. Additionally, as of the creation of this project, Bangladesh has not announced their squad, so players from Bangladesh will be missing from the analysis
